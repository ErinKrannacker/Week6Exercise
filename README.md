# Week6Exercise
Week 6 Group Assignment

Outline:
3 (basic) lines of code:
    -Name Input
    -Other Input
    -Do Something With Both Inputs

The program asks for the two inputs. It then prints the two inputs back on the console and asks the user if the inputs are correct. If the user says no, the program notifies the user that it did not work properly. If the user says yes, the program notifies the user that everything works well. If the user enters something other than yes or no, the program sends an error message.
